# One-time setup for a brand-new host: it has neither Ansible nor either
# repo yet, so reconcile.sh can't be the first step. Run this once, by hand
# or via cloud-init, then the systemd timer takes over (see reconcile.sh
# for what "either repo" means -- this framework repo + your own private
# fleet-config repo).
#
# Usage:
#   FRAMEWORK_REPO_URL=... FLEET_CONFIG_REPO_URL=git@github.com:you/fleet.git \
#   ./bootstrap.sh
#
# Access to the PRIVATE fleet-config repo is set up for you
# (ensure-access.sh): the host generates its own read-only deploy key and, if
# FLEET_CONFIG_REGISTER_TOKEN (a GitHub token allowed to manage that repo's
# deploy keys; used once, never stored) is set, registers it automatically --
# otherwise it prints the public key and waits for you to add it. To use a key
# you already have instead, pass FLEET_CONFIG_DEPLOY_KEY_FILE.
#
# Secrets are encrypted with sops to per-host age keys: this host generates its
# own key (ensure-age-key.sh), prints the public half, and you grant it its
# secrets from your admin machine (scripts/access.sh). No passwords are copied.
