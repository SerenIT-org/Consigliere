# What Consigliere is

(Renamed from ATC, then Kuzka, to Consigliere on 2026-08-21 — briefly
wobbled through "serenIT" while this repo's working directory got
shuffled around a sibling session's work on 2026-10-01, confirmed back to
Consigliere for good the same day.)

Consigliere is a single pane of glass for a fleet of hosts: baseline config,
provisioning, updates, security posture, and out-of-band hardware access
(KVM/DRAC/IPMI/AMT/SSH), all declared in git and continuously checked
against what's actually true — not just applied once and forgotten.

## The core discipline: declare, apply, and separately check for drift

This isn't a new idea invented for Consigliere — it's the same pattern already
proven out in [`novak`](../novak/novak), stated plainly in that project's
own decision log:

> "The shape: declarative input, dumb applier, fail loudly. That drift
> check is the more valuable half." — `novak/docs/decisions.md`

`novak status` compares the registry in git against what oMLX and Open
WebUI actually hold, and catches the failure that actually happens: someone
edits the live copy instead of the source, and it silently stops matching.
Consigliere applies the identical discipline to a fleet of machines instead of
one app's config:

- **Declare** in git (Ansible roles, Terraform, stack definitions).
- **Apply** via a dumb, idempotent pusher — `ansible-pull`, Arcane's sync,
  Terraform.
- **Check for drift** separately and continuously — this is the piece that
  makes the rest trustworthy instead of "ran once, hope it held."

Every module below is either a *declare-and-apply* half or a *drift-check*
half of this same loop. Naming a future `consigliere drift`/`consigliere status`
surface — the console view that says "here's everywhere reality has
diverged from git" across *all* modules, not just OS packages — is the
throughline that ties them into one project rather than a pile of
unrelated integrations.

## Public framework, private fleet repo

Settled 2026-10-01/02: this repo is public and meant to be reusable by anyone
running their own fleet. It holds the *framework of all the software* (roles,
libraries, the console, bootstrap) and **nothing of the operator's**: no
secrets, no site values, and no taxonomy, since tag names and "which roles run
where" are the operator's own design.

All of that lives in a separate **private fleet repo**, created from
[consigliere-fleet-template](https://github.com/almadon/consigliere-fleet-template)
(not a fork: forks of public repos can't be private). Its two purposes:
**customization** (node taxonomy, composition, apps, runbooks) and
**secrets/variables**. The framework references that repo and is responsible
for making sure every host can read it when deployed: each host generates its
own read-only deploy key and has it registered (`hosts/bootstrap/ensure-access.sh`).
`hosts/bootstrap/reconcile.sh` then assembles each run from both repos and
reconciles the host against itself. See [README.md](README.md).

Infra-level names (env vars, systemd units, the launchd label) stay
product-name-agnostic (`FRAMEWORK_REPO_URL`, `fleet-reconcile.*`).

## Modules

### Declared config — `hosts/` (Ansible + `reconcile.sh`)
OS baseline, Tailscale, Docker engine, backups. See [README.md](README.md).

### Provisioning — Terraform (not yet built)
Stands servers up, doesn't just configure ones that exist. Blocked on
settling the substrate (hypervisor/cloud/bare-metal — currently a mix).

### Backups — Arkeep (decided 2026-10-01, over Zerobyte)
`hosts/roles/arkeep_server` (one host, the `arkeep_server` group) and
`hosts/roles/arkeep_agent` (every backed-up host, the `arkeep_agent` group)
deploy [Arkeep](https://github.com/arkeep-io/arkeep) — restic+rclone under
the hood, central server + gRPC/mTLS agents, agents auto-enroll via the
server's HTTP API (no manual cert/token exchange for *this* part — see
below for what *does* need a manual step). Superseded an earlier generic
`hosts/roles/backup` (hand-rolled restic + systemd timer), retired once
Arkeep's own agent took over scheduling/retention. All real values (server
address, secrets) come from the private fleet-config repo.

**One thing that can't be automated**: the shared `arkeep_agent_secret` and
`arkeep_server_secret_key` go in vault like any other secret, but there's no
verified API for *minting* things — enrollment itself is automatic
(auto-PKI), so this is simpler than it sounds; see
`hosts/roles/arkeep_server/README.md` for the one manual step there is
(reverse-proxy wiring, if applicable).

### GitOps engine — Arcane (self-hosted via Ansible)
`hosts/roles/arcane_server` (one host) and `hosts/roles/arcane_agent`
(other Docker hosts) deploy [Arcane](https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane)
itself — previously assumed to just exist; this was a real gap until
2026-10-01 (Arcane obviously can't GitOps-deploy itself). The manager
variant uses Arcane's docker-socket-proxy-hardened compose shape since
that node is also internet-facing (reverse proxy). Agents run in **edge
mode** (as the manager's agent wizard generates): they poll the manager's
HTTPS URL outbound, so agent hosts publish no ports and need no firewall
changes. **One thing that can't be automated**: `arcane_agent_token` is
generated per agent by that wizard — a one-time manual step per agent host
(goes in that host's `config/vars/host/` file, not the shared
`config/vars/group/` files; a leaked token can be invalidated and
regenerated). The manager itself needn't be deployed by this role: an
existing manager works, agents just need its URL.

Also note: `getarcaneapp/arcane` is the *current* repo — it moved from
`ofkm/arcane` at some point before 2026-10-01; links elsewhere may still
say the old name.

### Containers — `stacks/` (Arcane)
Adopted, not built — Arcane already does compose/swarm GitOps sync well.

### Out-of-band hardware — flashctrl-sdk (sibling project, no code yet)
IP KVM, DRAC, IPMI, AMT, and plain SSH are four-plus different protocols
for the same two things: "show me the console" and "power/reset this."
[`flashCtrl`](https://github.com/tmeuze/flashCtrl) is meant to be the
single abstraction over that, so Consigliere's console consumes one SDK for
hardware actions instead of hand-rolling a protocol client per vendor.
Nothing exists there yet (empty repo, no commits) — the console's KVM
widget is a static link today and becomes a real action once flashctrl-sdk
has something to call.

### Update intelligence (new — not yet built)
Applying updates (already covered: `unattended-upgrades` in `baseline`,
Watchtower/Shepherd for containers) isn't the same as *knowing what
changed*. This module is reporting, not another updater:
- **OS packages**: [`apt-listchanges`](https://packages.debian.org/apt-listchanges)
  — mature, Debian-native, surfaces each package's actual changelog on
  upgrade. Adopt, don't rebuild.
- **Container images**: [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) or
  [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) for tag/digest diffs with
  links to release notes.
- **Breaking-change flagging**: a real heuristic Consigliere can own — semver
  major-bump detection across both of the above, surfaced in the console
  as "these updates likely need a look before they land," rather than
  trying to parse changelog prose for risk.

### Security posture / malware detection — Wazuh
The `wazuh_agent` role now enrolls a **Wazuh agent** rather than
running Lynis + maldet — fleet-wide file-integrity monitoring,
rootkit/malware detection, and log analysis with a real single-pane
dashboard, instead of Consigliere hand-rolling posture reporting on top of two
separate CLI tools. Same "adopt, don't reinvent" call as Arcane for
containers. The manager/indexer/dashboard stack lives in `stacks/wazuh/`
(vendored as a git submodule, see its README); `wazuh_server` (a new,
manager-only role) handles the one host-level prerequisite (OpenSearch's
`vm.max_map_count` sysctl). Scaffolded, not yet run against a live host.

### Fleet console — `console/` (Next.js)
Ties the modules together: OIDC via Pocket ID, per-machine metadata from
Outline, links/actions per host (KVM, SSH, dashboards), and — as the other
modules land — the place `consigliere drift` gets surfaced as one view instead
of five separate tools' separate dashboards. See
[console/README.md](console/README.md).

## What sets it apart from adopting something off the shelf

Every module above was picked *after* asking "does a robust existing tool
already do this" — most of them are adopted tools (Arcane, Wazuh, and
eventually apt-listchanges/Diun), not reinventions. What's actually
custom is small and deliberate:

- **Not a bookmark dashboard** (Homepage/Homarr): the console drives real
  actions — hardware control via flashctrl-sdk, config enforcement via
  Ansible/Terraform — not just curated links. (Homepage is still fine to
  keep running separately for general household links; Consigliere isn't trying
  to replace that use case.)
- **Not a second inventory database** (NetBox): metadata lives in Outline,
  which was already in daily use, via a documented per-machine convention
  — one source of truth instead of two.
- **Not a general enterprise platform** (Foreman/Fleet): scoped tightly to
  this actual stack — Tailscale-first, Ansible/Terraform, Arcane, Pocket
  ID — rather than a platform with its own opinions to work around.
- **Shares its philosophy with `novak` on purpose.** The declare/apply/
  drift-check discipline isn't a coincidence between the two projects —
  it's the same lesson (decision 18: "the drift check is the more valuable
  half") applied to a second domain, hardware fleets instead of one app.
- **Deliberately industrial, unlike `novak-konzol`.** Novak's console is
  built to look like "a kitchen appliance you happen to trust" — warm,
  calm, non-industrial, on purpose, because it holds things told to it in
  confidence. Consigliere's console is the opposite on purpose: it *is*
  infrastructure control, so it should look like one — legible status,
  clear risk levels, no pretending otherwise.

## Explicitly out of scope for now: Android TV / device MDM

Raised as a future need (wiping personal data on checkout) but deliberately
not folded into any module above. It's a different protocol (Android
Enterprise / Android Management API, not SSH/IPMI/KVM) and a different
trust model. If it happens, it's its own integration hanging off the same
console — not evidence that Consigliere needs to become a universal device
manager.

## Roadmap (as of 2026-10-01, user-stated priority order)

1. **Centralized backup management** — Arkeep chosen 2026-10-01, roles
   scaffolded, see Backups above. First real deployment target: two nodes,
   one running the Arkeep server + Arcane manager + reverse proxy, the
   other an agent-only node.
2. **Caddy → Traefik + Bunny "geoDNS" for existing edge proxies** — lives in
   a *separate* sibling repo, `geotraefik` (`~/Workspaces/Apps/tooling/geotraefik`),
   not here. That repo already has a real Traefik v3.6 + Bunny DNS-01 pilot
   committed. Don't duplicate edge/proxy work in this repo — this came up
   once already (see git history around 2026-10-01) and got reverted after
   confirming geotraefik is where it belongs.
3. **A web UI surfacing all of this** — this is `console/`, already built.
   A guest-portal web app (a fork the maintainer has) was mentioned as a
   framework worth drawing from for this — not yet located/reviewed; get the
   repo path before assuming anything about its stack or design.
4. **Wazuh rollout** — already scaffolded, see Security posture above.
5. **Full host + KVM control via flashctrl-sdk** — eventual, per a
   "flashDK/flashCtrl handoff" the user mentioned. No handoff details seen
   yet (unlike the geotraefik backup handoff, no cross-session note has
   come through for this one) — treat flashctrl-sdk's status as still "no
   code yet" until that surfaces.

## Open threads (tracked so they don't get re-derived)

- **Naming — settled 2026-10-01: Consigliere.** Working directory and repo
  should match this (see note below if they ever drift again).
- **Backup tool — settled 2026-10-01: Arkeep** (over Zerobyte).
- Terraform's provisioning substrate — hypervisor/cloud/bare-metal mix,
  unresolved.
- flashctrl-sdk has no code yet — the console's hardware actions are
  aspirational until it does (see Roadmap item 5).
- Outline vs. WikiJS — under consideration, doesn't block anything (the
  provider abstraction isolates it).
- Where this framework repo is hosted — currently GitHub
  (`github.com/almadon/consigliere`).
- Wazuh's default credentials need rotating before `stacks/wazuh/` touches
  anything but localhost — see its README's procedure.
- Update intelligence module (apt-listchanges, Diun/Renovate, breaking-
  change flagging) is named but not yet built.
- A guest-portal web app (a fork the maintainer has) — referenced as design
  inspiration for `console/`, location not yet provided.
- None of `arkeep_server`/`arkeep_agent`/`arcane_server`/`arcane_agent`
  have been run against a real host yet — scaffolded and template-rendering
  verified (valid YAML in both the standalone and behind-proxy branches),
  not deployment-verified.
